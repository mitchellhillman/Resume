	<p class="dropcap">Hi!</p>
	<p><strong>My Name is Mitchell Hillman and I am a graphic designer, sometimes illustrator, and programmer. I work as a User Interface Designer and Developer with the <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/Pages/index.aspx">CFA Institute</a>.</strong></p>
	<p>As a designer I strive to create marketing media that speaks the clearest possible message with the most delightful user experience. In pursuit of this goal I seek ways to combine minimal graphic design with a common-sense use of technology. </p>
	<p>Also, I believe that succeeding at design requires a firm grasp of production technique. For that reason I am fascinated with the practices of my trade. Being able to build what I concieve is very important to me. Currently I am working a lot with jQuery, SASS, Adobe CC, and Drupal, but I am learning about exciting new tools all the time.</p>
	<p>If you would like my help on one of your projects, please feel free to reach out through one of my social networks.</p>
