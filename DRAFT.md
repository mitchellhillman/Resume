Portfolio of intersting things made for myself. In that regard you can think of it as art.

All my life I've struggled to find the right way to present the sotry of myself and my work. I've thought that if I only phrased the accomplishments I've done well enough it would be worth something.

I am always torn between the doing and the presenting. The drawing and the portfoilo that houses it.
